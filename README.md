- **Update**: Modify the name or phone number of an existing contact in the contact list.
- **Delete**: Remove contacts from the contact list based on their name or phone number.
- **Checking**: Simulate phone call availability between contacts and determine if a contact is available to receive a call.
- **Random Number Generation**: Generate random numbers to simulate incoming calls and check if a contact is busy or available.
